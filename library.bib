In this paper, we argue that Explainable Planning can be designed as a service – that is, as a wrapper around an existing planning system that utilises the existing planner to assist in answering contrastive questions. We introduce a framework to facilitate this, along with some examples of how a planner can be used to address certain types of contrastive questions. We discuss the main advantages and limitations of such an approach and we identify open questions for Explainable Planning as a service that identify several possible research directions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York. Intervention autonomous underwater vehicles (I-AUVs) have the potential to open new avenues for the maintenance and monitoring of offshore subsea facilities in a cost-effective way. However, this requires challenging intervention operations to be carried out persistently, thus minimizing human supervision and ensuring a reliable vehicle behaviour under unexpected perturbances and failures. This paper describes a system to perform autonomous intervention—in particular valve-turning—using the concept of persistent autonomy. To achieve this goal, we build a framework that integrates different disciplines, involving mechatronics, localization, control, machine learning and planning techniques, bearing in mind robustness in the implementation of all of them. We present experiments in a water tank, conducted with Girona 500 I-AUV in the context of a multiple intervention mission. Results show how the vehicle sets several valve panel configurations throughout the experiment while handling different errors, either spontaneous or induced. Finally, we report the insights gained from our experience and we discuss the main aspects that must be matured and refined in order to promote the future development of intervention autonomous vehicles that can operate, persistently, in subsea facilities.},

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools used to build robotic systems. ROS is known for a distributed and modular design. Given a model of the environment, task planning is concerned with the assembly of actions into a structure that is predicted to achieve goals. This can be done in a way that minimises costs, such as time or energy. Task planning is vital in directing the actions of a robotic agent in domains where a causal chain could lock the agent into a dead-end state. Moreover, planning can be used in less constrained domains to provide more intelligent behaviour. This paper describes the ROSPlan framework, an architecture for embedding task planning into ROS systems. We provide a description of the architecture and a case study in autonomous robotics. Our case study involves autonomous underwater vehicles in scenarios that demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of our approach.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE. An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) needs to demonstrate a number of capabilities, in order to carry on autonomous missions with success. One of the key areas is correctly understanding the surrounding environment. However, most of the state-of-the-art approaches in labelling world information are based on the analysis of a single frame, whilst - especially in scenarios where the vehicle interact with complex structures - there is the need of sensor data from multiple views, in order to correctly classify world information. This paper presents an active approach to solve this problem, with a tree-based (path)-planner which makes the vehicle executing a specific set of actions (following a specific trajectory), in order to discriminate among several possibilities. Results in simulation, with varying parameters, have shown that the algorithm is always bringing the robot to locations where it is expected that measurements would be different, according to the different environment.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Many robotic applications require the detection of new objects in known environments. Common approaches navigate in the environment using pre-defined waypoints and segment the scene at these waypoints. Without knowing where to find new objects, this process can be time-consuming and prone to detecting false positives. To overcome these limitations we propose an approach that combines navigation and attention in order to detect novel objects rapidly. We exploit the octomap, created by the robot while it navigates in the environment, as a pre-attention filter to suggest potential regions of interest. These regions are then visited to obtain a close-up view for better object detection and recognition. We evaluate our approach in a simulated as well as a real environment. The experiments show that our approach outperforms previous approaches in terms of runtime and the number of segmentation actions required to find all novel objects in the environment.},

One of the original motivations for domain-independent planning was to generate plans that would then be executed in the environment. However, most existing planners ignore the passage of time during planning. While this can work well when absolute time does not play a role, this approach can lead to plans failing when there are external timing constraints, such as deadlines. In this paper, we describe a new approach for time-sensitive temporal planning. Our planner is aware of the fact that plan execution will start only once planning finishes, and incorporates this information into its decision making, in order to focus the search on branches that are more likely to lead to plans that will be feasible when the planner finishes.},

This paper explores the execution of planned autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) missions where opportunities to achieve additional utility can arise during execution. The missions are represented as temporal planning problems, with hard goals and time constraints. Opportunities are soft goals with high utility. The probability distributions for the occurrences of these opportunities are not known, but it is known that they are unlikely, so it is not worth trying to anticipate their occurrence prior to plan execution. However, as they are high utility, it is worth trying to address them dynamically when they are encountered, as long as this can be done without sacrificing the achievement of the hard goals of the problem. We formally characterize the opportunistic planning problem, introduce a novel approach to opportunistic planning, and compare it with an on-board replanning approach in the domain of AUVs performing pillar expection and chain-following tasks.},

AI Planners can efficiently construct plans to achieve this long-term autonomous behaviour. However, in plans which are expected to last over days, or even weeks, the size of the state-space becomes too large for current planners to solve as a single problem. These problems are well-suited to decomposition and abstraction planning techniques. We present a novel approach in the context of persistent autonomy in autonomous underwater vehicles, in which tasks are complex and diverse and plans cannot be precomputed. Our approach performs a decomposition into a two-level hierarchical structure, which dynamically constructs planning problems at the upper level of the hierarchy using solution plans from the lower level. Solution plans are then executed and monitored simultaneously at both levels. We evaluate the approach, showing that compared to strictly top-down hierarchical decompositions, our approach leads to more robust solution plans of higher quality.},

The deployment of robots in public environments is gaining more and more attention and interest both for the research opportunities and for the possibility of developing commercial applications over it. In these scenarios, proper definitions and implementations of human-robot interactions are crucial and the specific characteristics of the environment (in particular, the presence of untrained users) makes the task of defining and implementing effective interactions particularly challenging. In this paper, we describe a method and a fully implemented robotic system using conditional planning for generating and executing short-term interactions by a robot deployed in a public environment. To this end, the proposed method integrates and extends two components already successfully used for planning in robotics: ROSPlan and Petri Net Plans. The contributions of this paper are the problem definition of generating short-term interactions as a conditional planning problem and the description of a solution fully implemented on a real robot. The proposed method is based on the integration between a contingent planner in ROSPlan and the Petri Net Plans execution framework, and it has been tested in different scenarios where the robot interacted with hundreds of untrained users.},
