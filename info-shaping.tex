The problem of selecting which information to reveal, which we call {\em information shaping}, is challenging because the space of information shaping options may be extremely large, and because more information need not make an agent's intention easier to recognize, or even help the robot achieve a better utility.
Our interest here is in modulating the behavior of the robot through information shaping. By changing the actor's knowledge, we can potentially change its behavior and the way by which it acquires the information needed to achieve it's goal.  We restrict the information shaping interventions to be truthful  so that they cannot convey false information.
In the context of contingent, partially-informed planning agents, this requirement is naturally implemented by requiring that we may only improve the actor's sensor model, i.e., improving its ability to  access the  value of some environment feature.
