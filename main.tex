\section{Introduction}

%% MOTIVATION
We present a demonstration of using hidden costs for task planning and navigation.
%
A hidden cost is a cost that is not accounted for in the planner's model directly. In this demo we focus on hidden costs in navigation only. A hidden cost in this context could be an area of carpet upon which a low-profile robot is only able to move slowly, or is at risk of getting stuck. A cost could also be a user preference for the robot to avoid a certain area because it is a high-traffic area for humans. We combine navigation costs from multiple sources, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Areas in which navigation is particularly difficult.
    \item Costs that favour areas where the intention of the robot is easier to discern.
    \item Costs that favour areas of higher utility.
    \item Costs that are derived from social norms, such as avoiding areas that block human traffic.
\end{itemize}
%
Importantly a robot that enters the environment for the first time is not aware of these costs. The robot's model of the environment is in two parts: (a) the task planning model (consisting of a domain model and an initial configuration, including goal) and (b) data that can be sensed or requested by the robot but is not included in the planning model, such as the occupancy grid and the navigational cost map.

In order for the hidden costs to alter the behaviour of the robot, the costs must be embedded into the information already available. Our system does this in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Cost-based Discretisation}, and
    \item \textit{Combined Costmaps for navigation}.
\end{enumerate}
Using a combination of these techniques the robot is able to generate more efficient solutions, solve more problems, and behave in a more preferable way with respect the hidden costs.

%% SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
We have designed an implemented a system using ROSPlan~\cite{Cashmore2015a} to perform task planning and execution on-board a mobile robot, taking into account hidden costs. The system architecture is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:arch}.

\begin{figure}[!th]
    \centering
    \input{tikz_graph.tex}
    \caption{Waypoint Sampling (a) the continuous space is discretised into waypoints for planning; (b) different costmaps are combined; (c) waypoints for task planning are sampled.}
    \label{fig:sampling}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Cost-Based Discretisation}

In order to generate a task plan, the continuous space is first discretised into a set of symbolic waypoints. This is done in ROSPlan using a Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM). In generating the PRM there is a tradeoff between completeness and complexity. A dense PRM will lead to problems that are more difficult for the planner to solve, whereas a sparse PRM might fail to include waypoints that are vital in achieving the goals. For example, if the goal is to grasp a cup and no waypoint is placed within reachable distance to the cup, then no solution will be found.
%
These vital positions are unknown before the plan is generated, although points of interest (such as positions surrounding the cup) are known.

In order to generate a PRM that has a high probability of including vital positions, our system generates a dense PRM and then samples a number of waypoints that does not exceed the planner's capacity. The probability of sampling a waypoint is a weighted sum over the hidden cost maps of that waypoint's grid cell. This process is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:sampling}.

Task planning is then performed using the sampled waypoints. If the problem is unsolvable, then the system re-plans, adjusting the costs and re-sampling waypoints.

% In this section we:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Briefly describe the PRM generation in ROSPlan.
%     \item Describe how the waypoints are filtered by sampling based on the costmaps of hidden cost.
%     \item Describe how this process is used within a system for planning and execution.
% \end{enumerate}
%
% In this section discuss how a set of waypoints is sampled from the initial dense PRM. Figure~\ref{fig:sampling}.
%
% In this section briefly discuss how the plan is generated and executed. Explain replanning with resampling.

\subsection{Combined Costmaps for Navigation}

In this section describe how we produce a map for movebase to use.
